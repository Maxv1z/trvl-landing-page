## Description

TRVL Landing Page is a single-page application built using React, designed to offer a smooth and interactive experience for users interested in hiking. The page includes various sections that cover essential information about hiking levels, gear selection, and map reading. 🥾🌲

This project was build with an idea to upgrade myself as a future Front-end programer, since the main idea of this position is to implement the design using code. So the same did I: I searched for design on Dribble and Figma websites and found one, that was good looking for me and which has something interesting to think about while buildng. 
### So, that's how the initial design looks like:

The `src` folder contains various components that compose the landing page. Images and assets are stored in their respective directories. The `App.js` file serves as the main entry point for the application.

## Dependencies

The TRVL Landing Page project relies on the following external packages and libraries:
- [framer-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) - A library for animations and transitions in React applications. Here it was used for text appear on scroll animation. Later I'm planing to study it fully and use in all of the projects.
- [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) - A popular CSS extension language, which allows writing styles in parent styles, what is more convinient and for what mainly was used.
